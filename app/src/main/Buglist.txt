-Rotator keeps going past upper bound until it gets stuck at 400 degrees (also, doesn't that angle measure imply that we'll be in negative if we rotate past 0?)
- RSSI and channel from received packets aren't parsed properly (probably fixed)
-After an unspecified amount of time with autoRotate toggled off, the receiver will spontaneously start rotating counterclockwise and won't stop until you force it to in some way
-Some slight kinks in the rotation state machine to be ironed out
-Recovery from disconnect errors needs to be implemented as a safeguard
-All errors and exceptions should get written to a file so that we can debug things after a long period of time (just pipe logcat out?)
    -Exception handling in general should be better; currently there is no recovery from any kind of runtime exception

-Some packets stored in the logs are much longer than they should be; they have the full correct packet and then up to several hundred bytes of additional bad data. We should stop adding more to parse after 251 bytes.
-Include logging magnetometer data as well as the potentiometer data to firebase
-Firebase worker is not launching. When OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder is uncommented in WorkerWrapper.kt,
    works, but causes a bunch of "no auth tokens for request" warnings
